# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning where agents learn optimal behaviors through interaction with an environment, guided by a system of rewards and penalties.

## 📘 What is Reinforcement Learning?

Unlike supervised learning, RL does not rely on labeled datasets. Instead, an agent learns to make sequences of decisions by:
- Observing the environment,
- Taking actions,
- Receiving rewards or penalties,
- Updating its strategy (policy) to maximize long-term reward.

## 🔁 Core Loop

At each time step:
1. The agent observes the current **state**.
2. It chooses an **action** based on a **policy**.
3. The environment transitions to a new state and gives a **reward**.
4. The agent learns and repeats this process.

## 🧩 Key Terminology

| Term         | Description                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent**     | The decision maker interacting with the environment.         |
| **Environment** | The system within which the agent operates.                |
| **State (s)**   | A snapshot of the environment at a given time.             |
| **Action (a)**  | A decision the agent can make.                             |
| **Reward (r)**  | Numerical feedback signal based on the agent's action.     |
| **Policy (π)**  | Strategy used by the agent to decide actions.              |
| **Episode**     | A full sequence of interactions until a terminal state.    |
| **Q-value**     | Expected return of taking an action in a given state.      |
